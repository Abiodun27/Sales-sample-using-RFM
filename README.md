# Project Title
Data Analysis of Automobile sales dataset using SQL and Tableau

# Project Description, Introduction and Objective
In this project, data science & analytics skills were used to explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights. 
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle, which includes columns such as 'Order number', 'Quantity ordered', 'Price each', 'Orderline number', 'Sales', 'Ordered date',
'Status', 'Quantity id', 'Month id', 'Year id', 'Productline', 'Productcode', 'Customername', 'Phonenumber', 'Addressline1' etc.

The Sales database was created in Postgresql with the table which contains the columns listed above. The data was inspected, so as to have an understanding of 
some of its features, check for missing values and duplicates. Analysis was then performed on the data by answering certain questions using SQL, followed by getting
more insight by visualization using Tableau. The following questions are answered during the analysis:

* What is the most sales by productline?
* Which year is most sales made and how much was made?
* Why is least sales made in 2005? (they only operate for 5 months)
* Which of the dealsize made the most sales and how much it made?
* What was the best month for sales in a specific year and how much was earned that month?
* In which country is the most sales made and how much was made?
* In which country is the productline most expensive?
* What is the status of most the products?
* Who is our best customer ?(this could be best answered with RFM Analysis)
* What product are most often sold together?
